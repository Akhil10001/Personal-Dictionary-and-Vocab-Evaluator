  "description": "This website works as your personal dictionary, just online. On this website, you can take those heavy words from that Shakespearean novel you are reading and add your interpretation of those words on the website, personalising the meaning of the word in your online dictionary as you see fit. After a certain number of words have been added, you can test your ability to recollect the words you added with the flashcard quiz section, which would then display the statistics based on how well you did on the quiz.",
